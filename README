volatile
--------

A (dead) simple volatile data storage written in Go.


FEATURES

• Automatic cleanup via goroutines!
• Get, Set, Has and Remove methods!
• Can be as fast (or slow) as you wish!
• Does not use any external libraries, only native go!
• Absolutely unsafe memory-wise and probably more resource-intensive than any other alternative.


USAGE

Check out 'volatile_test.go' for some examples.


INSTALLING

go get github.com/BiRabittoh/volatile
