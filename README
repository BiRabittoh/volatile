volatile
--------

A (dead) simple volatile data storage written in Go.


FEATURES

• Automatic cleanup via goroutines!
• Can be as fast (or slow) as you wish!
• Does not use any external libraries, only native go!
• Absolutely unsafe memory-wise and probably more resource-intensive than any other alternative.


USAGE

Use NewVolatile to create a new cache.
Then, you can use the following methods:
• Get
• Set
• Has
• Clear
• Remove
• Length


Check out 'volatile_test.go' for some examples.
